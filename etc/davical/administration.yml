#
# Administration Configuration file (sample)
#
#  This file is only used by command-line programs accessing the DAViCal
#  database for maintenance.  It should be as secure as you can make it
#  since it contains passwords and connection details for a more powerful
#  database connection.  Mode 600 is recommended.
#
#  This file should be called 'administration.yml' in the config directory.
#
#  Make sure field-separating whitespace does not contain any ^I (tab)
#  characters. The YAML parser will trip over them ungracefully.

##
